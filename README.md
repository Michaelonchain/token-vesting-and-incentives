# Token Vesting & Incentive Design

This repository demonstrates practical token engineering approaches for designing
sustainable vesting schedules and incentive mechanisms in Web3 projects.

## What this repo covers
- Token vesting models for teams, investors, and ecosystem rewards
- Incentive design aligned with long-term protocol growth
- Simple simulations and scenario analysis
- Best practices to avoid inflation-driven sell pressure

## Who this is for
- Web3 founders
- DAOs and protocol teams
- Investors and token designers

## Focus Areas
- Long-term alignment
- Emission control
- Behavior-driven incentives

## Next Steps
Additional models and simulations will be added progressively.
